- [x] Simple and clean look
- [x] Custom image picker with permission checking
- [x] Image cropping
- [x] Flash light
- [x] Zoom
- [x] Tap to focus

### Installation & Requirements
This project requires Xcode 9 to run and compiles with swift 4
> Note: This library makes use of the AVFoundation camera API's which are unavailable on the iOS simulator. You'll need a real device to run it.

CocoaPods:
Add the following to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'ALCameraViewController'

// For swift 3.2 support
pod 'ALCameraViewController', '~> 2.0.3'
```

Carthage:

```ruby
github "alexlittlejohn/ALCameraViewController"
```


### Privacy (iOS 10) ###
If you are building your app with iOS 10 or newer, you need to add two privacy keys to your app to allow the usage of the camera and photo library, or your app will crash.

Add the keys below to your `Info.plist`, adding strings with the description you want to provide when prompting the user.

```
    NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription
    NSCameraUsageDescription
```

### Usage

To use this component couldn't be simpler.
Add `import ALCameraViewController` to the top of you controller file.

In the viewController
```swift

let cameraViewController = CameraViewController { [weak self] image, asset in
	// Do something with your image here.
	self?.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
}

present(cameraViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

### Parameters

There are a number of configurable options available for `CameraViewController`

```swift
init(croppingParameters: CroppingParameters = CroppingParameters(),
     allowsLibraryAccess: Bool = true,
     allowsSwapCameraOrientation: Bool = true,
     allowVolumeButtonCapture: Bool = true,
     completion: @escaping CameraViewCompletion)
```

The Cropping Parameters struct accepts the following parameters

```swift
init(isEnabled: Bool = false,
     allowResizing: Bool = true,
     allowMoving: Bool = true,
     minimumSize: CGSize = CGSize(width: 60, height: 60))
```

The success parameter returns a `UIImage?` and a `PHAsset?` for more advanced use cases.
If the user canceled photo capture ten both of these options will be `nil`

```swift
typealias CameraViewCompletion = (UIImage?, PHAsset?) -> Void
```
> Note: To prevent retain cycles, it is best to use a `[weak self]` reference within the success parameter

### Other usage options

You can also instantiate the image picker component by itself as well.
```swift

let croppingEnabled = true

/// Provides an image picker wrapped inside a UINavigationController instance
let imagePickerViewController = CameraViewController.imagePickerViewController(croppingEnabled: croppingEnabled) { [weak self] image, asset in
		// Do something with your image here.
	 	// If cropping is enabled this image will be the cropped version

    self?.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
}

present(imagePickerViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)

```

For more control you can create it directly.
> Note: This approach requires some familiarity with the PhotoKit library provided by apple

```swift
import Photos

let imagePickerViewController = PhotoLibraryViewController()
imagePickerViewController.onSelectionComplete = { asset in

		// The asset could be nil if the user doesn't select anything
		guard let asset = asset else {
			return
		}

    // Provides a PHAsset object
		// Retrieve a UIImage from a PHAsset using
		let options = PHImageRequestOptions()
    options.deliveryMode = .highQualityFormat
    options.isNetworkAccessAllowed = true

		PHImageManager.default().requestImage(for: asset, targetSize: PHImageManagerMaximumSize, contentMode: .aspectFill, options: options) { image, _ in
        if let image = image {
						// Do something with your image here
        }
    }
}

present(imagePickerViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)

```
